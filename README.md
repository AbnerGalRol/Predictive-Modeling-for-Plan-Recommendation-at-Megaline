# Predictive-Modeling-for-Plan-Recommendation-at-Megaline
In this project, we will develop a predictive model to recommend mobile phone plans to Megaline customers, a telecommunications company.Megaline aims to migrate customers from legacy plans to their new Smart and Ultra plans. Using behavioral data from customers who have already migrated to the new plans, we will implement a machine learning model to analyze customer behavior and predict which of the new plans (Smart or Ultra) would be most suitable for each customer.

The main objective is to achieve a prediction accuracy of at least 0.75. To accomplish this, we will use data processing techniques and predictive modeling to train and evaluate our model, ensuring it can correctly classify customers into the optimal plan for them. This project combines data analysis and machine learning to provide personalized recommendations to Megaline customers, aiming to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency for the company.

## Data Description
